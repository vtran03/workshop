### Problem Statement
 Define the problem. What is the harm I am seeking to investigate and why is it significant within the context of my selected LMIC?

 Bugna and Nguimkeu investigate the issue of formal and informal businesses, with one being taxed and regulated by the Cameroon government while the latter is in a gray area which is not taxed or regulated by the government. Formal businesses have the benefit of access to credit, which is a necessary transition for some informal businesses in order to develop as a business. However, there are many constraints preventing informal businesses from becoming formal businesses such as entry costs and tax. These constraints vary based on location, which Bugna and Nguimkeu display using a geospatial analysis of cities across Cameroon and the variation of business types in the respective cities. Through this research, the authors intend to identify the types of policies that could remove current constraints preventing informal businesses from formalizing. 

This paper relates to Amartya Sen’s idea of human development because it concerns the opportunity for people to take advantage of their capabilities. If the constraints to formalize a business are removed, then entrepreneurs have access to credit to advance their business and provide jobs for other people. 

This paper most closely follows sustainable development goal #8 regarding fair economic growth because it shows the distribution of informal and formal businesses across Cameroon and the difficulties that certain locations have with the transition from an informal to formal business.

They used a spatial analysis of the General Enterprise Census and National Survey on Employment and the Informal Sector to map out the areas of informal and formal businesses and used cross section testing to identify what types of areas were most profitable and in what industry. While they did not specifically mention how they mapped their census data spatially, one could assume that they either used a top-down or bottom-up approach. One factor that they saw had significant correlation with economic success is the distance to the nearest roads and the average road density of the cities the businesses reside in. They then used this data to form counterfactual samples to make predictions on what would happen if factors such as tax rates, government revenue, and job creation has on the profit of these businesses.

They use data science strategies such as Ellison and Glaeser index to calculate the concentrations of industries within certain regions. From this, they observed that 60% of industries are weakly or strongly concentrated. This is relevant since there is a lower linkage between buyers and suppliers since the cost to transport goods is higher. They also used Krugman’s Specialization Index at the 4 digit NACE level. They also used OLS regression to test the correlation between entrepreneurial profit and population density with regional infrastructure.
