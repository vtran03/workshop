Selim Jahan denounces the focus on economic growth as a quanitifier of human development. Values such as GDP should not be used as a standard to compare nations on human development, because it is narrow-minded and does not truly measure the human development. He first defined what exactly what human development, which is the combination of having the capabilities of humans enhanced, such as access to high quality health care and nutrition, and the opportunities for people to utilize their capabilties such as being able to innovate and be an entrepreneur. Rather than focusing on economic statuses of each country we should be using what he calls a "focus measure". This is a combination of three attributes: having a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. 

Additionally, Selim Jahan encourages a focus on the entirety of works, not just income-based jobs that are a necessity for a person to surivive. This includes creative works such as music and art, care work like taking care of the elderly or children, and volunteer work such as working at a shelter. When we focus on all of the types of works, we will be able to help maximize human's reaching their potential as they will be constructive member's of society contributing to different parts.
