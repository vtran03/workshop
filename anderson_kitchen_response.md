**Prompt**: In Anderson's 2008 Wired article he descirbes how the data deluge is serving to make the scientific thoery obsolete. Kitchen provides a rebuttal to Anderson's argument that theory is dead with his suppoistion that in fact we have entered a fourth paradigm what you think? Do you believe thoery is dead? Do you think we have indeed entered a paradigm shifting revolution for how we describe analyze, and understand the world. 

Kitchen mentions several arguments against the complete reliance on data science and rely on its output as the end all be all without any need for thoery. For example, data collection cannot be completely unbiased since the methods are not all encompassing. For example, when someone gets data from exit-voting polls, they will be using the data from people who have chosen to both go to the voting station and answer questions from the news organization. This excludes people who might not have the ability to go to the voting stations or are not interested in answering any questions for the news company. In order to recgonize these biases, there must be scientists who can understand that this bias exists and shift any conclusions about the data accordingly. If scientists do not do this and end up taking the results of their data at face value, then the conclusions will be skewed in a way that is not reflective of the population and could end up being ineffective in what it will be used for. 

Another example is the pure processing power it takes to compute all data and all different methods. While it may be possible to runs the popular models on smaller datasets, it is both time-consuming and expensive to do that using much larger dataset and much more niche models in addition to running it through AI models. Companies that try to do this will realize that their spending much of their money on computations that will not provide them any net profit. Therefore there is a need to know what computations will create the most net gain. The scope must be decreased instead of using all data and all methods in full resolution. A scientist needs to create a theory in order to make sure that everything they do will in fact lead to a net gain. Therefore theory is not dead. We cannot just rely on the pure output of Big Data computations

While theory is not dead, we are indeed entering a different paradigm of Science where the methods and ideologies we use have changed because of the evolution of Data science. Theory and hypotheses do not need to rely only on expertise and intuition of the scientists, but can and should be based on a prepatory phase that inlcudes very simple review of what evidence we currently have. This way we can have a preemptive understanding of what we may receive from pursuing such research. This is what Kitchen refers to in his explanation of abduction in the new fourth paradigm: a blend of induction and deduction in the scientific process.
