The City of God is a clear example of social networks’ impact on the development of society as groups such as the several gangs who “owned” sectors of the City of God, the police who both ignored the paying gangs and sold their arms supply to them, the runts who robbed and attacked innocent members of the community, and the people who purchased drugs from the gangs interact with each other and expand as the movie progresses. Many of the ideas of Geoff West are portrayed in this film such as the Dunbar number, the growth of links to people compared to the growth in number of people, and the super linear scaling. 

City of God started as a new city, but lack of urban planning and spending by the higher ups led to the people feeling like they were betrayed by the upper government. This led to contempt that inspired people like the Tender Trio to perform robberies and hold ups that steal money from businesses and gives it to members of the community. The adults in the city did not like the violence in the community but did feel contempt from the lack of assistance from the government, so they remained tight-lipped about the Trio when police came, except Shorty. The effects of this poorly developed and enforced government is seen with the bribery of police by drug gangs. With Lil Z paying off the police to look another way when selling drugs, he was able to act freely and create his own legal system. Further events show that the city is a complex and adaptive environment as well, such as the actions of individuals like Rocket who is supposed to represent the average person in the City of God not directly involved with the gangs but has his life irreparably changed by them. People like Rocket are forced to live life hiding from the gangs like how he avoided Lil Z every time he saw him. He knew that if he did not avoid him like the plague, he chanced losing his life like when Lil Z took over the drug house.  He adapted to his environment in order to survive. Many other innocent members of the City of God followed suit. 

The City of God is an example of the type of city that Geoff West imagines in his book. For example, the idea of fractals is followed since the city can be split into sectors based on drug dealers, which then have their own systems of production, sales, and management. Within every system present in the City of God, there are several smaller ones that are similar to it. Dunbar’s rule was also closely followed by the gang system in the City of God. The boss was close to only a few members of the gang, like how Lil Z was close to Benny. The majority of people were lower down in the chain of command starting as lookouts when they are children, but then people are selected to roll the drugs, wield weapons, or sell the drugs to members of the community when they show that they are competent enough to do so. During the war with Carrot’s gang, Lil Z gave away arms regardless of his connectivity with the people, like kids . He was handing them out like candy, which shows his desperation to defeat Carrot and Knockout Ned and his lack of concern for the safety of people. This kind of system is shared with all of the drug dealers in the City of God, showing the optimization and complexity made as the system develops. 

The development of gangs is also representative of superlinear scaling throughout the movie as well. A good example of this is the ease to sell drugs or access to guns. As the size of Lil Z’s gang grew, the number of people who became sellers increased which increased the number of people who could get access to drugs. With the increase of people who produced drugs, the production of the assembly line increases superlinearly because assembly lines are optimized by having more people to specialize in certain parts of the production line, leading to a superlinear scaling of the production of joints and cocaine. Sublinear scaling can also be seen as Lil Z’s gang expands throughout the City of God. As the number of competitors decreases and his market share expands, he is able to be increase his prices or be less competitive in general because he slowly becomes the main supplier besides Carrot. 

Tobler’s First Law of Geography matches very closely with the movies main idea of “If you run away, they get you. If you stay, they get you”, basically saying that members of the community were permanently intertwined with the events that occur in the City of God. Not a single person in the City of God was left unhurt from the actions of the drug dealers, the runts, and the police. From the moment they were born, kids of the city were inducted into the crime life by becoming runts, stealing and attacking innocent people and being tolerated by Carrot. Police were indirectly involved as they were bribed and sold their weaponry to Lil Z. Each and every person in the City of God was affected by the actions of other residents. Rocket for example, was too poor to leave the city and become a photographer. Instead he saw as people he knew as kids such as Benny and Lil Dice became intertwined with the criminal underground with no chance of escape. The viewer even sees Rocket try to go into the criminal side by wanting to perform holdups, but not having the lack of consciousness to do them. He then interacts with Lil Z’s gang as a photographer, spreading their images to newspapers. Even Knucklehead Ned who was a member in the military somehow ended up becoming one of the head members of Carrot’s gang. Clipper, who had left the Tender Trio in order to work in the church was affected since violence supported by the exchange of arms puts the lives of many people at risk. These people did not want to participate in the criminal events, but they inevitably became both victims and actors due to them being residents of the City of God. 

Overall the City of God is representative of many of the characteristics of cities and systems that Geoff West mentions such as being complex and adaptative, being made out of fractals of smaller systems, the superlinear and sublinear growth of certain aspects of the city, and the linkage and closeness between people. Every resident of the City of God was involved as actors or victims in the events and had to adjust their lives accordingly.
